      "description": "We'd never need an excuse to visit Gochu, but if we DID, a six-course lunch or dinner for just $75 would definitely do it. Yup, in what is one of THE best value menus this Restaurant Month comes half a dozen dishes of the best freakin' Korean you'll ever eat, period. Head on over to Gochu's stylish spot inside Commercial Bay and prepare for a feast of cured kingfish with apple and anchovy consomme, chilli, shallots and crispy seaweed—a fried chicken slider with Gochu mayo and Korean pickles—and crispy eggplant with doenjang glaze, tofu cream and sesame, amongst other deliciousness. You might even consider splashing out on their wine matches for the evening, starting from $39.",

      "description": "Burgers and beers are always a good time, especially when you can grab both for $25 from Park Hyatt Auckland's epic daytime eatery, The Pantry. In keeping with their incredible menu, this burger is anything but average and features a mouthwatering togarashi-spiced grass-fed patty stacked with bacon and Kikorangi blue cheese, which you'll enjoy with an ice cold glass of Hallertau #9 (but only after tucking into an entrée of shoestring fries of course). The downside? It's a lunch-only affair.",
